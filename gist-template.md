# Regex Simplified

Regex Simplified is a quick and easy tutorial that explpains what regex (regular expressions) are and their uses. After this tutorial you should find that this is a simple way of learning a daunting new challenge.

## Summary

In this tutorial I will be going over what goes into regular expressions and how they are used. Regex is a sequence of patterns that are use to replace characters in strings. These strings and patterns are used for many different things such as URLs, HTML, Email, or even Hex Values. These help create a unique place for specific links to occure. Here is a good example of what a regex is:

## URL REGEX
# /^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/

We will go further into what regex is and all the details along this tutorial.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

`/^`(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?`$/`
We need to start from the beginning, which would be anchors. Anchors are what the expression has at the beginning and the end that are highlighted. The `^` Matches the beginning of the string while the `$` Matches the end of the string. They are used to signify the beginning or the end of an expression.
